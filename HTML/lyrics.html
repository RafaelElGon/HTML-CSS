    Sailing the Sunset Strip
    I’m a bit of a king
    Granny would take a trip
    I’ve been bending the strings
    Got hammers in both my hands
    Such a delicate touch
    They say I’m from Amsterdam
    Does that make me Dutch?

    Please don’t remember me
    For what I did last night, oh
    Please don’t remember me
    Lord and children
    Please don’t remember me
    It’s only 1980, it’s only 1983

    Smoking the reefer
    Feeling my own light
    My brother’s a keeper
    I married a TV wife
    The devil’s Camaro
    Parked in the high school lot
    A little sombrero
    ‘Cause teacher was way too hot

    Please don’t remember me
    For what I did last night, oh
    Please don’t remember me
    Listen lord now
    Please don’t remember me
    It’s only 1980, it’s only 1983

    Tell my love “But leave me never”
    Can’t complain about the weather
    Snowing at the rainbow, have a ball
    Cut my teeth down at the whiskey
    GTOs tried to kiss me
    One more song, they have seen it all

    Please don’t remember me
    For what I did last night, oh
    Please don’t remember me
    What’d I say lord?
    Please don’t remember me
    It’s only 1980, it’s only 1983
    Please don’t remember me
    For what I did with David
    You know I’m talkin’ David Lee
    Am I ready?
    Please don’t remember me
    For what I did last night, oh
    I guess I played a Flying V
